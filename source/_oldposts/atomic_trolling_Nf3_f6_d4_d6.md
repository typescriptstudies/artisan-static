The idea behind this move, is that now the usual Nc3 e4 Nb5 threats won't work. We still play the two knights attack theme by playing 3. Nc3 c6, however now we play for a new weakness, namely attacking the d6 pawn with e5. To start off we don't allow Bg4 pinning the knight, instead we sack the knight and block Bg4 with f3.

Now the routine 6.. Nf6 loses ont he spot. We play 7. e5 and there is no good way of meeting the Nb5 threat:

The correct move is 6.. g6. Now we follow up with  7. e5 Bh6 8. Bg5 Nf6 9. Nd5:

Black freed up the position enough, so that the knight can be taken without material loss, but after 9.. cxd5 10. Bb5+ Kf8 11. Be8 white has a solid positional advantage:
